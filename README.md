# A Vim-Based Integrated Research Environment

A Vim-based academic research and writing environment, with very few dependencies and vim plugins. Build a sprawling, densely-connected Zettelkasten, and draft academic articles, books or presentations without ever leaving Vim.  

## Dependecies

- A recent version of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or Neovim.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), a universal document converter.
- [vim-pandoc](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc) and [vim-pandoc-syntax](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax).
- A decent color scheme, such as [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) or [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), the command-line fuzzy finder.
- A `bibtex` bibliography file, or a reference manager that can produced it, such as Zotero with [Better BibTeX](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) or [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/).
- For previewing: [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) in any *nix distro, or [Marked2](https://marked2app.com/), in macOS. (Optional: you can also use any browser or PDF viewer.)
